# Risk-analysis-lab--Cybersecurity-
 A cybersecurity risk analysis lab demonstrating quantitative and qualitative risk assessment methods, including EF, SLE, ARO, ALE calculations and risk prioritization across real-world IT scenarios.

# Risk Analysis Lab (Quantitative & Qualitative)

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of cybersecurity risk analysis techniques using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The lab focuses on identifying threats, estimating potential losses, and prioritizing risks to support informed security decision-making.

## Objectives
- Apply quantitative risk analysis methods such as EF, SLE, ARO, and ALE
- Perform qualitative risk analysis using a risk impact matrix
- Analyze multiple business scenarios involving IT infrastructure and data assets
- Compare risk likelihood and impact to determine appropriate prioritization

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Asset Valuation** (Tangible and Intangible Assets)
- **Exposure Factor (EF)**
- **Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)**
- **Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)**
- **Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)**
- **Qualitative Risk Analysis (Low, Moderate, Major, Severe)**

## Scenarios Analyzed
- Customer database server risks
- Laptop theft, damage, and malware
- Storage Area Network (SAN) failures
- Point-of-Sale (POS) system threats
- Private cloud facility risk assessment

Each scenario includes calculated risk values and qualitative assessments to demonstrate how organizations evaluate and prioritize cybersecurity threats.

## Tools & Methodology
- Quantitative calculations based on industry-standard risk formulas
- Qualitative analysis using a probability vs impact risk matrix
- Scenario-based evaluation reflecting real-world business environments

## Why This Matters
Risk analysis is a foundational skill in cybersecurity. This lab showcases the ability to:
- Translate technical risks into financial impact
- Support risk-based decision making
- Align security controls with business priorities
